atm-solution project

The atm-lab code creates the ATM, but the methods in the Bank and BankAccount 
classes which actually do the banking functions are incomplete.
The lab class exercise (with tutor support) is to complete the BankAccount.

atm-solution includes the code to do this

The assessment project uses atm-solution as the starting point for adding
new features as discussed in lectures and seminars. Tutors may not help directly 
with this but will talk you through examples and answer questions.
